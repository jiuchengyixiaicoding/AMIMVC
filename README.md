# Abstract
Most of the existing multi-view clustering methods are based on the assumption that the data is complete. However, real-world data collection faces various problems. For example, the damage of data storage equipment, limited to the current technology lead to the lack of collection means and so on. Although some incomplete multi-view clustering methods have been proposed, the existing methods mainly have the following two problems: (1) they focus on the consistency of views, but cannot fully mine the consistency of views, and only use the semantic level consistency information, and do not explore the instance-level consistency and complementarity. The combined effect of the two features of views will improve the performance of the model. (2) Self-supervised contrastive learning algorithm mistakenly identifies negative and positive samples, which leads to false negative and false positive samples. These samples mislead the model and have a negative impact on the performance of the model. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes Affinity Matrix Guided Multiple Contrastive Learning Incomplete Multi-view Clustering (AMIMVC). First, we use a high-order random walk to construct a kinship matrix, and use the affinity matrix to guide the contrastive learning of the same view and different views at the instance level, the complementarity of views is utilized, and the low-dimensional consistency is mined. The guidance of the affinity matrix in contrastive learning alleviated the problem of false negative and false positive samples recognition. After a large number of experiments, it is confirmed that our proposed method has good performance on both complete views and missing views. After comparing multiple IMVC models, it is confirmed that our model has a significant improvement in performance.

After the incomplete multi-view features are completed by inference evaluation, z<sup>o</sup> and z<sup>t</sup> are encoded by the original encoder and the target encoder for comparison. The original encoded features are mapped to another view space through the cross-view decoder to obtain xr, and z<sup>t</sup> is cross-compared with xr, that is, xr<sup>1</sup> is compared with z<sup>t</sup><sub>2</sub>, and xr<sup>2</sup> is compared with z<sup>t</sup><sub>1</sub>. zo is also passed to the clustering module for semantic comparison.
# Requirements

# DataSets
In order to prove the performance of our model under datasets of the same type but different sample numbers, we choose Handwritten and MNIST-USPS datasets for experiments.Due to prove the performance of ATIMVC under different types of data sets with increasing sample numbers, we add BDGP and Fashion data sets for experiments.
